; Character Progression Control - the skill-cap trampoline stub.
;
; WHY THIS IS ASSEMBLY AND NOT A BYTE ARRAY:
; the patch site is not a call we can redirect - it is a 9-byte instruction that loads the
; constant 100.0 into a register, and replacing it means calling code of our own that puts a
; different number there and returns. That code has to obey a register contract exactly. Hand
; encoding it as a blob of hex would be untestable and unreviewable; written here, the assembler
; validates every instruction at build time and the contract is readable.
;
; THE CONTRACT AT THE PATCH SITE (Skyrim SE 1.5.97, Address Library 41561 + 0x76), read from
; the working reference - Kasplat's Skyrim Skill Uncapper, whose Nexus permissions allow it:
;   ESI    holds the skill's ActorValue id (6 = One-handed ... 23 = Enchanting)
;   XMM0   holds the skill's CURRENT level and must survive untouched - the instruction right
;          after the site is `comiss xmm0, xmm10`
;   the maximum goes into XMM8 on Skyrim SE 1.5.97 (Kassent's 2017 site: `comiss xmm6, xmm8`)
;          and into XMM10 on the AE shape (Kasplat's listing: `comiss xmm0, xmm10`) - one stub per
;          shape below, chosen at install time from which shape the scan actually found
; The site is reached by a 5-byte CALL; the 4 bytes after it are NOPs, so a plain RET resumes
; the game at the instruction after the original 9-byte load.
;
; This stub inserts a CALL into the MIDDLE of a game function, so it preserves every volatile
; register the compiled callee may clobber (RAX, RCX, RDX, R8-R11, XMM0-XMM5) and aligns the
; stack to 16 bytes before calling, as the x64 convention requires. XMM6-XMM15 are callee-saved,
; so the callee preserves them itself; XMM10 is set deliberately, after the call.
;
; Technique credited to the Skyrim Skill Uncapper lineage (Kassent, Vadfromnu, Elys, Kasplat).
; No code is copied: this is our own stub, our own settings and our own location check.

; Stage 3, skill-to-level income. This takes the place of the game's `call` to its level-experience

; skill id the caller keeps in rsi goes along as the second argument), and RET returns to the game's
; call site with the scaled value in xmm0.
;
; THE CALL SITE IS NOT AN ORDINARY ONE. The compiler built it knowing exactly which registers the
; original leaf touches, so the game RELIES ON THE REST SURVIVING THE CALL: the instruction right
; after it is `addss xmm0, [rcx]` - rcx still holds the experience field (measured 2026-09-06: a
; logger call inside the hook clobbered rcx and the game read 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, crash log
; crash-2026-09-06-04-04-19.log). A compiled C++ hook may clobber any volatile register, so every
; one the original does not provably clobber is preserved around the hook call: rcx, rdx, r8-r11 and
; xmm1-xmm5 (the original converts through eax - `cvttss2si eax, xmm1` is in its shape - so rax is
; not relied on). RSP is 8 mod 16 on entry (after the game's call); 28h aligns it for the original,
