// Character Progression Control - runtime byte-signature scanning.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS, and it is not a preference:
//
// The retail SkyrimSE.exe is Steam-packed. It carries a .bind section and its entry point sits
// inside it, not in .text, which means the real code is ENCRYPTED ON DISK and only decrypted
// into memory when the game runs (measured 2026-09-03 - ordinary instruction sequences appear
// nowhere in the shipped file, while arbitrary byte probes match, which is only possible if the
// section is encrypted). So a byte signature cannot be checked ahead of time against the file;
// it can only be found in the running process.
//
// That settles the design. A patch that needs a signature scans for it at load, in memory, and
// the result is a fact the mod reports rather than an assumption it acts on:
//
//   * found exactly once  -> a verified address for THIS runtime, whatever version it is.
//   * found several times -> refused. An ambiguous signature is worse than none, because the
//                            wrong one of several matches is a crash with no clue attached.
//   * not found           -> refused, reported, and that patch group stays off while the rest of
//                            the mod carries on.
//
// A signature is data, not code: it is the one thing that has to change when a Windows or Skyrim
// update moves the game around, and nothing else in the mod needs to know.
